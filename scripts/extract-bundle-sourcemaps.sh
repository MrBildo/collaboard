# Move the browser bundle's sourcemap sidecars out of the build output, so the
# inventory in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md can be derived from the SAME build that
# ships rather than from a second build compared against it.
#
# Why a move rather than a copy-then-delete, and why this exists at all:
#
#   The notices file needs sourcemaps (they name the npm packages that actually
#   reached the bundle). The archive must not contain them. Those two facts used
#   to be reconciled by building the frontend twice -- once plain to ship, once
#   with sourcemaps to read -- and asserting the two builds were byte-identical.
#   They are not required to be: repeated builds of an unchanged tree draw one of
#   two variants of one shared chunk, so the assertion failed on a healthy tree
#   often enough to teach people to re-run it. Building once removes the question
#   instead of answering it.
#
#   That makes the removal load-bearing in a way it never was before. A build
#   that emitted no sourcemaps at all, or a removal that quietly matched nothing,
#   would leave the inventory derived from an empty set (silently describing
#   nothing) or leave .map files in the tree that is copied into wwwroot and
#   packaged (silently shipping our own source layout). A third thing can go
#   wrong that neither of those catches: the build mode itself. `--sourcemap
#   hidden` is what lets this move happen without leaving the code pointing at
#   the files it just relocated -- `hidden` writes the sidecars without adding
#   a `sourceMappingURL` comment naming them, where the more familiar
#   `--sourcemap true` writes both. Lose the word and every check above still
#   passes; every shipped file would just ask a browser for a map that no
#   longer exists. So all three are asserted here -- maps were produced, none
#   remain, nothing left references one -- and verify-archive.sh independently
#   rejects any .map that reaches a packaged archive.
#
#   The move happens before anything reads the build output, so every later step
#   inherits a tree with no sourcemaps in it rather than having to remember.
#
# Usage:
#   extract-bundle-sourcemaps.sh <dist-dir> <sourcemap-dir>
#     <dist-dir>       the Vite build output (sourcemaps are moved OUT of this)
#     <sourcemap-dir>  where they are moved TO; recreated on each run. Keep this
#                      outside the Vite root -- Tailwind's content scan is rooted
#                      there and skips only what git ignores, so an unignored
#                      directory inside it becomes an input to the next build.

# one of them. What breaks is invisible to both -- every shipped .js/.css
# would carry a reference to a map that was moved out from under it here and
# deleted before packaging, so a browser's devtools would 404 fetching it.
# Cosmetic, but exactly the unasserted-load-bearing-step shape this pipeline
# exists to remove, so it gets its own check rather than riding on the other two.
